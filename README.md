# Science-CrossCoupling Paper Tutorial

A step-by-step code tutorial for the Science paper (DOI: 10.1126/science.aar5169) by Doyle group ( @ Princeton University). 

Their codes and original datasets of this paper are also avaiable on GitHub (https://github.com/doylelab/rxnpredict). 

Most of these data in their project were processed by R including data processing and machine learning models training, in this tutorial, these data are processed by python. 

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a quick guide for people who has chemistry background and are interested in data analysis/machine learning. 

This code tutorial is for study use only, not for any commercial use.
